# Traditional Image Processing for Filtering, 3D Reconstruction, and Image Stitching

## Objectives

You will implement and compare classical computer vision techniques for:
1. Image filtering and enhancement
2. 3D reconstruction from stereo images
3. Image stitching from multiple views

## Part A â€“ Image Filtering

### Task 1: Source code

Apply and compare different traditional filters to remove noise and enhance images:
- Mean filter
- Gaussian filter
- Median filter
- Laplacian sharpening

Deliverables:
- Original, noisy, and filtered images (side-by-side)
- Comparison of filters on noise reduction and edge preservation

### Task 2: Comparative Analysis

Compare at least two alternative methods or parameter settings.
Discuss:
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Quantitative evaluation (e.g., PSNR, number of inliers)
- Qualitative visual inspection

### Task 3: Final Report Guidelines

Submit a clearly written Markdown report including:
- Introduction and motivation
- Description of methods with equations/diagrams
- Implementation steps and results
- Comparison and analysis
- Conclusion and possible extensions
